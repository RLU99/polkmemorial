        <h1>Who was the Fighting Bishop of the Confederacy?</h1>
        <p> Leonidas polk.

Born at Raleigh, N. C., April 10, 1806, Leonidas Polk was graduated at the U. S. Military Academy, West Point, 1827. It was during his connection with the academy that he received holy baptism at the hands of the Rev. Charles Pettit Mcllvaine, and shortly after his graduation he was confirmed in Christ Church, Raleigh, by Ravenscroft.

Resigning his commission in the army with a view to entering the ministry, he was admitted to the diaconate in the Monumental Church, Richmond, Va., by Bishop Channing Moore, April 11, 1830, and was advanced to the priesthood by the same prelate in Christ Church, Norfolk, Va., May 22, 1833.

His service as assistant to the bishop at the Monumental Church was terminated by loss of health, which made a visit to Europe necessary, and on his return he removed to Tennessee, where he became rector of St. Peter's, Columbia. In 1835 he was a deputy to the General Convention. In 1838 Columbia College conferred upon him the doctorate in divinity.

Chosen by the General Convention to the missionary episcopate, he was consecrated bishop of Arkansas and the Indian Territory south of 369 30' of latitude, with provisional charge of Alabama, Mississippi, and the republic of Texas, in Christ Church, Cincinnati, Dec. 9, 1838. His consecrators were Bishops Meade, Smith, McIlvaine, and Otey. In 1841 he was elected first bishop of Louisiana, and resigned his missionary episcopate.

Polk was a judicious administrator, a scholarly theologian, an eloquent preacher, and an influential member of the Upper House. His views were those of the " Evangelical‚Äù school; and his broad culture and sympathetic interest in the young led him to take an active part in the first foundation of the University of the South, at Sewanee, Tenn.

Intense in his Southern sympathies, and still retaining his interest in military matters, on the breaking out of the Civil War he threw himself heartily into the secession movement, and was commissioned a major-general of the Confederate forces. While on duty in the vicinity of Marietta, Ga., he was mortally wounded, and died in the faith and peace of God, June 14, 1864.

Works.-Other than his official addresses, etc., Polk left nothing in print. - William Stevens Perry.  "The Bishops of the American Church, Past and Present." (1897)</p>
